# Oops, I did it again
[flashbacks to my vencord plugin](https://github.com/KaydaFox/vencord-buttplugio)

# How to use? 
To use this plugin, make sure you have [spicetify](https://spicetify.app). Clone the repo and run `yarn install`.
After this, run `yarn run build`, add the app to your spicetify config with `spicetify config extensions spiceplug.js`. Now you can restart spotify (if it doesnt get restarted) and the plugin should be there. 
The plugin has some settings which you can find in spotifys settings menu right at the bottom
